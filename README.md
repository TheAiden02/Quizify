# Quizify
Quizify is a webapp which allows users to connect to their Spotify account and play a simple game where they choose the more popular from two random tracks in their library. The user can decide how many rounds they want to play or play an endless gamemode that allows them to keep going until they choose to end the game. Quizify is built on Flask, and currently uses a SQLite database to store user information. Quizify is currently under development, and changes are being made frequently, including new features, graphical updates, and major infrastructural changes. The Spotify app handling API requests is currently in development mode, and users must be added manually by the development team in order to connect to Spotify.

# Future Plans
Quizify is a labor of love being developed for fun and for personal and professional development. All future plans are subject to change. In the immediate future, we intend to add more features to Quizify's single player experience, such as allowing users to pull songs from their own and Spotify's public playlists. We also intend to continue updating the UI to create a more polished experience and make updates to backend processes to improve performance and efficiency. In the long term, we hope to transform Quizify into a real-time multiplayer game where users compete against one another.
